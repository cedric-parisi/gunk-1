## About gunk

gunk is built using [gunk/gunk](https://github.com/gunk/gunk) a modern frontend and syntax for [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

The `gunks` directory contains gunk definitions for the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
implementation.  
Along with the [gunk annotations](https://github.com/gunk/opt) to expose gRPC services via REST and generate  
swagger documentation.
